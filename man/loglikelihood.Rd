\title{Compute the log-likelihood ratio score}
\usage{
loglikelihood(df, coeff, R0 = 1, RA = 2, yemp = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{DataFrame. First column are Parsonnet Score values within a range of zero to 100 representing
the preoperative patient risk. The second column are binary (0/1) outcome values of each operation.}

\item{coeff}{NumericVector. Estimated coefficients \eqn{\alpha}{alpha} and \eqn{\beta}{beta}
from the binary logistic regression model. For more information see details.}

\item{R0}{double. Odds ratio of death under the null hypotheses.}

\item{RA}{double. Odds ratio of death under the alternative hypotheses.
Detecting deterioration in performance with increased mortality risk by doubling the odds Ratio
RA=2. Detecting improvement in performance with decreased mortality risk by halving the odds
ratio of death RA=1/2.}

\item{yemp}{boolean. If TRUE use observed outcome value, if FALSE use estimated binary logistc
regression model.}
}
\value{
Returns a single value which is the log-likelihood ratio score.
}
\description{
Compute the log-likelihood ratio score.
}
\details{
Using .... include equation of log-likelihood ratio here and use
 \code{\link{gettherisk}} to calulate the risk of failure.
